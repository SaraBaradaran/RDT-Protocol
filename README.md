# Reliable-Data-Transfer-Protocol


We have implemented a reliable data transfer protocol like TCP using raw socket. This protocol has been used in a hypothetical transportation system.
You can read more about how this transportation system works by reading the project file.


## Usage guide

### Requirements

### Step 1: Download Python Files
You can clone codes using the below command:
```
git clone https://github.com/klee/SaraBaradaran/RDT-Protocol
